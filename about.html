            <p> As a young 6th grader, while surfing youtube, I came across a intriguing video: The one punch man challenge. The man in the video committed himself to running 10km, doing 100 pushups, 100 situps, and a 100 squats a day and in the process of doing so transformed his body. Deciding that I can do the same I decided to begin running 3 miles everyday, along with the same one punch man routine. Combined with Fraser WIlson’s 10 minute ab routine and a healthy diet, I began to see visible changes in my body. Albeit inefficient training, I found love for exercise and eventually set a personal best in the mile of 5 minutes and 30 seconds as a 6th grader. </p>
            <p>Fast forward a couple months, while at a friend's house, I was exploring his home gym. I had seen videos of fitness influencers online, lifting weights, and I thought that I could do the same as well. While I was attempting to pick a weight off the ground any way I could, my friend’s brother walked in. He offered to help me learn how to lift weights correctly and my love for lifting weights began. I started lifting 3 times a week along with my running routine and gaining strength. Eventually, the workload proved to be too much, and I toned down running to focus on building muscle. I spent countless hours researching videos online to help with nutrition, and improve technique, and continued improving..</p>
            <p>Covid hit and when the gyms were closed, I begged my dad to get home gym equipment. Though initially hesitant, his persistence resulted in us purchasing the essentials: a rack, a bar, and some bumper plates. While forced into quarantine, I continued to lift at home building up my lifts in a powerlifting style manner. Then, on a whim, I decided to sign up for a powerlifting meet, where the electric atmosphere captured me. I hope to keep hitting new personal records and challenging myself everyday.

            <p>
              My friend’s brother, who taught me how to lift, also took part in wrestling. Never have hearing about the sport before, I decided to give it a try. I googled “Dougherty Valley Wrestling” and searched for the head coach's email. Though slightly intimidated by the prospect, I sent the coach my interest in wrestling, as well as my current lifting stats. He emailed me back, inviting me to watch a practice. While visiting this practice, I saw a small room of about 10 wrestlers. Though it was a small room, all the wrestlers exuded passion and dedication, which I decided then that I wanted to be a part of. During the summer I joined their high-school summer program, where I began with the very basics. The first move I learned, a single leg, though seemingly simple, took me a long time to learn. Frustrated with my rate of progress, I bought a small 10 by 10 wrestling mat, which I used to practice what I learned at practice each day. Even though I tried my hardest, I ended the freshman season with a losing record, challenging my determination.
              </p>
            <p>
              Through wrestling, the coaches taught me to never give up, and constantly seek to improve. This led me to join the wrestling program at the community youth center, where I further practiced their “three d’s”: discipline, dedication, and desire. Through my efforts in the offseason, I became the school’s first North Coast Section placer in over half-a-decade.
            </p>
            <p>With the help of all my coaches, I continued to strive for improvement everyday. I hope introduce young individuals to the sport of wrestling as my friend’s brother did for me, as well as spread my knowledge that I have accumulated through the help of my coaches.
